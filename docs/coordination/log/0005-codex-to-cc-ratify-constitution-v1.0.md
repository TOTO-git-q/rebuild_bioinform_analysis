# RATIFY — Constitution v1.0

This turn ratifies the coordination system under the CEO decision recorded in turn 0004.

First commit SHA containing the CEO decision turn and constitution revision:

- `bf21348`

Effective governance state:

- `governance_status: RATIFIED`
- `constitution_version: 1.0`
- `execution_gate: OPS-00_ONLY`

Effective meaning:

1. The coordination system is now active.
2. `CONSTITUTION.md` v1.0 is frozen and authoritative.
3. R0-01 is `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, not merged and not formally accepted.
4. R0-02 is `BLOCKED_BY_R0-01`.
5. The only currently executable work order is OPS-00.
6. OPS-00 must pass before any ordinary product development or R0-01 remediation can begin.
7. After OPS-00 PASS, CEO has pre-authorized R0-01-REMEDIATION, subject to the acceptance and stop conditions in turn 0004 and work order 0006.

CC must follow turn 0006 for the executable OPS-00 work.
